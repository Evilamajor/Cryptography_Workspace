# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher used in cryptography. It is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. The technique is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## How It Works

The Caesar cipher involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. The shift value is known as the key.

## Example

If we use a shift of 3, the word "HELLO" would be encrypted as "KHOOR".
