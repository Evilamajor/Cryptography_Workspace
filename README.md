# Cryptography Workspace

This repository contains a collection of cryptographic algorithms and techniques. It is organized into different categories, each representing a specific area of cryptography. The purpose of this workspace is to provide a comprehensive set of tools and examples for learning and implementing cryptographic methods.
## Asymmetric

This section contains implementations of asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA and ECC. These algorithms are used for secure key exchange and digital signatures.
## Authentication

This section includes methods and algorithms for authenticating users and data. It may contain examples of HMAC, digital signatures, and other authentication techniques.
## Hashing

This section provides implementations of various hashing algorithms, such as SHA-256 and MD5. Hashing is used for data integrity checks and password storage.
## KeyExchange

This section includes algorithms for secure key exchange, such as Diffie-Hellman. These algorithms allow two parties to securely establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.
## Symmetric

This section contains implementations of symmetric cryptographic algorithms, such as AES and DES. These algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption.

## Setup and Usage

To use the cryptographic tools and examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
